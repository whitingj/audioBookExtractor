A simple python script for OSX that will extract audiobooks into mp3 files by disc.

Lame and cdda2wav are needed for this script to work.  I personally use brew (http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/)
to install those but mac ports should work as well.

Run ./audioBookExtractor.py -h to get help on the command.
